<u><h1> What is Findr.TU</h1></u>
Findr.TU is an initiative to develop a set of platforms and services for everyone associated with Thapar University, Patiala; from students to faculty and from cafe owners to rickshaw drivers. We are working on a set of projects to achieve this, the main one being our cross-platform mobile application.

</br><u><h1>Where do we stand</h1></u>
<p>A number of functionalities have been added and tested in the main application and we are continuing to add new features every day. The app will positively be launched by July 2022. Because we didn't have any designers, there is alot to work on the UI. </p>
<h2>Current functionalities</h2>
Some of the functionalities(for students) in working state as of now are:
<li>Navigate throughout the campus with AR Navigation.</li>
<li>Lodge hostel complaints from your phone.</li>
<li>Get your timetable directly in JPG.</li>
<li>Get personalized announcements.</li>
<li>View walls of all cafes containing details and essential info.</li>
<li>Get all wifi passwords and important contacts.</li>
<br><p>Other than functionalities for students, we have developed many for admins and cafe owners too. For example, admins can make announcements to roll numbers, years, departments, etc. Student finder can fetch admins the schedule of students on the given day. Cafe owners can create customizable walls where they can add their pictures, menus, and details.</p>

<h2>Functionalities in development</h2>
Some of the functionalities(for students) that we are working on are:</r>
<li>Instant campus E-Rickshaw bookings.</li>
<li>Buy/Sell mattresses, books, cycles, etc.</li>
<li>Webkiosk on phone.</li>
<li>Personal messaging.</li>
and more...

</br><u><h1>Goals</h1></u>
We want Findr.TU to be the new normal when it comes to doing stuff in TIET. A hassle-free method of doing everything by students, teachers, admins, drivers, cafe owners, parents, and more. Achieving this is no easy task, so we are always looking for support from our own college students in order to make a sustainable community that runs this.

</br><u><h1> If this idea interests you </h1></u>
We are in the process of creating a self-managed community of students from TIET who share our vision and want to contribute to this initiative in any way possible. Anyone interested can contact Aryan Sethi at
